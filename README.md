In this study, we propose a multithreaded Sudoku validator designed to expedite the validation process through parallelism. The validator divides the Sudoku grid into discrete sections, assigning each section to an individual thread for simultaneous validation. Leveraging parallel processing capabilities, this approach aims to improve efficiency by distributing the workload across multiple threads.The validator incorporates synchronization mechanisms to ensure coherent and error-free validation results. Through meticulous thread management and allocation strategies, it aims to optimize resource utilization while validating the puzzle's rows, columns,and subgrids concurrently.
